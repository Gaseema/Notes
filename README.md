# Notes

The book explains how to advocate a user-centered design which is a philosophy that things should be designed with the needs and interests of the user in mind, making products that are easy to use and understand.

Design Should:

-make it easy to determine what actions are possible at any moment
-make things visible, including the conceptual model of the system, the alternative actions, and the results of actions.
-Make it easy to evaluate the current state of the system
-Follow natural mappings between intentions and the required actions; between actions and the resulting effect; between the information that is visible and the interpretation of the system state
We should be able to figure out what to do and be able to tell what is going on

Principles for making difficult tasks simple ones:

-Simplify the structure of tasks
-Use of both knowledge in the world and knowledge in the head
-Exploit the power of constraints, both natural and artificial
-Make things visible
-Get the mappings right
-Design for error
-When all else fails, standardize

Three aspects to mental models: 

-The design model 
-The user’s model 
-The system image 

Ways to simplify the structure of tasks:

-Keep the task much the same, but provide mental aids.
-Use technology to make visible what would otherwise be invisible, thus improving feedback and the ability to keep control.
-Remove unnecessary steps of a task)
-Use technology to simplify something)
Do not take control away from the user.

Bridge the gulfs of Execution and Evaluation:

Make things visible so users know what actions are possible
Make things visible so people can see the results of their actions
The system should have actions that match the users’ intentions
Design for Error:

Make it so mistakes aren’t too critical, undoable, etc.
Make things difficult?

Sometimes a difficult design is good- it forces us to deliberately focus on what we’re doing (focus on it)
Good for dangerous equipment, operations, secret doors, etc.
Make things easy to use? 

To make something easy to use, match the number of controls to the number of functions and organize the panels according to function. 
To make something LOOK easy, minimize the number of controls.
